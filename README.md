# DATA STRUCTURES LAB (SYLLABUS)

## Experiment 1:

> Write a program that uses functions to perform the following operations on singly linked list:
>
> I. Creation.
>
> II. Insertion.
>
> III. Deletion.
>
> IV. Traversal.

## Experiment 2:

> Write a program that uses functions to perform the following operations on doubly linked list:
>
> I. Creation
>
> II. Insertion
>
> III. Deletion
>
> IV. Traversal


## Experiment 3:

> Write a program that uses functions to perform the following operations on circular linked list:
>
> I. Creation
